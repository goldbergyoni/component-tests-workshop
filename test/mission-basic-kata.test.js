    // 💡 TIP: The the tests in watch mode: npm run test:dev
    // 💡 TIP: When in watch mode, within the terminal/CMD type "p" -> Then start typing this file name, choose it
    //  It should run only this file. Click "w" to return to the main menu
  });

  // 💡 TIP: Down below, there is an example event schema
  test('When category is not specified, should get http 400 error', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const eventToAdd = {
      temperature: 20,
      color: 'Green',
      weight: 80,
      status: 'active',
      category: 'Something',
      // 💡 TIP: Consider explicitly specify that category is undefined by assigning 'undefined',
      category: undefined
    };

    // Act

    // 💡 TIP: use any http client lib like Axios OR supertest
    // 💡 TIP: This is how it is done with Supertest -> await request(expressApp).post("/sensor-events").send(eventToAdd);
    const response = await request(expressApp).post("/sensor-events").send(eventToAdd);

    // Assert
    // 💡 TIP: verify that status is 400
    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });

  // 💡 TIP: Consider checking both the HTTP status and the body
  test('When inserting a valid event, should get successful response', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const eventToAdd = {
      temperature: 20,
      color: 'Green',
      weight: 80,
      status: 'active',
      category: 'Something',
      // 💡 TIP: Consider explicitly specify that category is undefined by assigning 'undefined'
    };

    // Act
    const receivedResult = await request(expressApp)
      .post('/sensor-events')
      .send(eventToAdd);
    // 💡 TIP: use any http client lib like Axios OR supertest
    // 💡 TIP: This is how it is done with Supertest -> await request(expressApp).post("/sensor-events").send(eventToAdd);

    // Assert
    // 💡 TIP: verify that status is 400
    // this was probably a mistake, we should get a 200 status here, cause the response is successful
    expect(receivedResult).toMatchObject({
      status: 200,
      body: eventToAdd,
    });

    const addedResult = await request(expressApp).get(`/sensor-events/${receivedResult.body.id}`);

    });
  });

  // 💡 TIP: In the assert phase, query to get the event that was added
  // 💡 TIP: Whenever possible, use the public API for verification (not direct DB access)

  // ✅ TASK: Test that when a new event is posted to /sensor-events route, the temperature is not specified -> the event is NOT saved to the DB!
  // 💡 TIP: Testing the response is not enough, the adequate state (e.g. DB) should also satisfy the expectation
  // 💡 TIP: In the assert phase, query to get the event that was (not) added - Ensure the response is empty

  // ✅ Keep the tests very short and readable, strive not to pass 7 statements per test
  // 💡 TIP: If it gets too long, extract obvious parts into an external helper

  // ✅ TASK: Test that querying the GET:/sensor-events route, it returns the right event when a single event exist
  // 💡 TIP: Ensure that exactly one was returned and that this is the right event
  // 💡 TIP: Try using as few assertions as possible, maybe even only one. expect(apiResponse).toMatchObject({//expected object here})

  // ✅ TASK: Test that querying the GET:/sensor-events route, it returns the right events when multiple events exist
  // 💡 TIP: Ensure that all the relevant events were returned

  // ✅ TASK: Code the following test below
  test('When an internal unknown error occurs during request, Then get back 500 error', async () => {
    // Arrange
    // 💡 TIP: Factor a valid event here, otherwise the request will get rejected on start and the failure won't happen
    // 💡 TIP: Make some internal function fail, choose any class method
    // 💡 TIP: Use the library sinon to alter the behaviour of existing function and make it throw error
    //  https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/stubs/
    // 💡 TIP: Here is the syntax: sinon.stub(someClass.prototype, 'methodName').rejects(new Error("Error explanation"));
    // Act
    // Assert
  });

  // ✅ Ensure that the webserver is closed when all the tests are completed
  // 💡 TIP: Use the right test hook to call the API and instruct it to close

  // ✅🚀 Learning TASK: Test that when a new valid event is posted to /sensor-events route, if the temperature exceeds 50 degree a notification is being sent
  // 💡 TIP: This was not covered in the course yet. To achieve this read about the library 'nock' which can verify that the http://localhost/notification/{notificationCategory} service was called
  // 💡 TIP: Add the field notificationCategory to the event and set some value. This will be added to the notification call URL
  // 💡 TIP: The call to the notification service happens in the file 'sensors-service.js'

  // ✅🚀  TASK: Test that querying for /sensor-events route (i.e. get all) and sorting by the field 'temperature', the results are indeed sorted
  // 💡 TIP: Each test should be independent and might run alone without others, don't count on data (events) from other tests

  // ✅🚀  TASK: Let's ensure that two new events can be added at the same time - This ensure there are no concurrency and unique-key issues
  // Check that when adding two events at the same time, both are saved successfully
  // 💡 TIP: To check something was indeed saved, it's not enough to rely on the response - Ensure that it is retrievable
  // 💡 TIP: Promise.all function might be helpful to parallelize the requests

  // ✅🚀 When adding a valid event, we get back some fields with dynamic values: createdAt, updatedAt, id
  //  Check that these fields are not null and have the right schema
  // 💡 TIP: Jest has a dedicated matcher for unknown values, read about:
  //  https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectanyconstructor

  // ✅🚀 Spread your tests across multiple files, let the test runner invoke tests in multiple processes - Ensure all pass
  // 💡 TIP: You might face port collision where two APIs instances try to open the same port
  // 💡 TIP: Use the flag 'jest --maxWorkers=<num>'. Assign zero for max value of some specific number greater than 1
